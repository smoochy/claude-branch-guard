"""branch-guard: a Claude Code PreToolUse hook.

Reduces git/branch-related approval prompts while keeping a human in the loop
for anything that touches a protected branch (main/master) or is destructive.
For Bash `git`/`gh` commands it emits a per-command decision:

  allow  — safe to auto-approve (read-only git/gh, staging, branch creation,
           fetch, a commit/push of a feature/worktree branch, …);
  ask    — confirm first (commit/edit/push to a protected branch, or a
           destructive command like `reset --hard`, `clean -f`);
  (none) — defer: emit nothing, so the normal permission flow applies.

`git branch` is classified by what the session OWNS rather than by how
destructive the verb looks (`classify_branch`). A target is in bounds when it is
recoverable — its tip is reachable from a remote-tracking ref or a local
integration branch (RECOVERY_REF_PATTERNS), so the worst case is a
`git reset --hard <sha>` — and private, meaning not in the protected set. This
only ever relaxes a would-be `ask` into an `allow`, and only on proof from a
local git query: a foreign repo (`git -C`), an unreachable git, or a branch that
won't resolve all keep asking. The non-force spellings need no query, because
git already enforces the same check (`-d` refuses unmerged work; `-m`/`-c`
refuse an existing destination), so only `-D`/`-M`/`-C`/`-f` are probed.

A command is auto-approved only when EVERY segment in it is recognized-safe — a
git/gh invocation classified `allow`, a read-only pager piped after one
(`git log | head`), or a side-effect-free label/no-op (`echo "---"`) — so a
non-git command can't ride along into an approval (`git status && rm -rf foo`
defers rather than allows). A segment that writes a file via an output redirect
(`git log > f`, `echo x > f`) is downgraded out of `allow` for the same reason.
A command/process substitution (`` `…` ``, `$(…)`, `<(…)`) likewise downgrades a
would-be `allow` to defer — except a small registry of provably pure ones
(`$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`, `$(git branch --show-current)`, `$(pwd)`),
which are treated as substitution-free so idioms like
`gh pr view "$(git branch --show-current)"` stay auto-approvable.

Heredoc bodies are dropped before lexing (`strip_heredocs`) so their (data)
contents aren't parsed as command segments — a `git commit -F- <<'EOF' … EOF`
stays auto-approvable instead of deferring on the body's foreign-looking lines.
An unquoted-delimiter body that the shell would expand (a command substitution
in it runs) is kept in the stream so the substitution guard still defers.

Also guards file edits (Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit) against the branch of
the file's own repository — except for a gitignored path, which holds no branch
contents to protect (`path_is_ignored`) — and `git push` according to
BRANCH_GUARD_PUSH_POLICY.
The protected set is `main`/`master` plus any glob patterns in
BRANCH_GUARD_PROTECTED_BRANCHES (see `protected_patterns`).

Reads the hook JSON on stdin, emits a PreToolUse decision on stdout. On any
parsing uncertainty (unbalanced quotes, empty input, unresolvable branch,
unknown subcommand) it defers silently so normal permissions apply — never
fail closed.

In a non-interactive permission mode (auto / dontAsk / bypassPermissions) there
is no human to answer a prompt, so a would-be `ask` is emitted as `deny`
instead — the guard fails safe. (`bypassPermissions` ignores hook decisions
entirely, but emitting `deny` there is harmless and future-proof.) A classifier
reason states only the CAUSE; `confirm()` adds the closing clause, so the two
paths read honestly — an `ask` offers a confirmation, a `deny` says there is
none to be had and points at the terminal instead.

Scope note: branch-guard reasons about git/branch *semantics*. The filesystem
boundary (commands touching paths outside the workspace) is workspace-guard's
job; the two don't overlap.

    on a remote-tracking ref or main, so the worst case is a
    `git reset --hard <sha>` — and *private*, meaning not in the protected set.
    A protected branch is shared, so it always asks.

    This can only ever relax a would-be `ask` into an `allow`, and only on
    proof: every form the probes can't answer for keeps asking, so an
    unreachable git, a foreign repo, or a branch that doesn't exist all land on
    today's behavior rather than a new approval.

    The non-force spellings need no probe at all, because git already enforces
    the check the guard would duplicate: `-d` refuses to delete unmerged work,
    and `-m`/`-c` refuse to clobber an existing destination. Only the force
    spellings can lose commits. `-D`, `-M`, and `-C` are the force forms of
    `--delete`, `--move`, and `--copy`, and `-d --force` is `-D` spelled long —
    so force is read from the whole flag set, never from one letter.

    *Shared* and *recoverable* are independent questions, and git only ever
    enforces the second. The shared one is therefore answered once for all
    forms, up front, via `protected_targets` — not inside each verb branch,
    where an early allow-return could sit above it and answer "not shared" by
    omission. That is what made `git branch -d main` auto-approve, and hoisting

    from what is really "no directory" and the edit deferred with no prompt.
    The branch is knowable from any existing ancestor, because a repo covers its
    whole subtree — including the directory about to be created in it.

    Climbing stops at the filesystem root, which is not a repo, so a path under
    no repo still resolves to no branch and defers exactly as before. When an

    outside the worktree, pathspec magic git refuses) — so uncertainty keeps the

    Probes the REALPATH, not the path as given: a symlink inside an ignored
    directory is itself ignored, but the write lands on its target, so probing
    the link would exempt an edit to a tracked file. Resolving also fails in the
    safe direction — a link out of the worktree reports not-ignored and keeps
    the ask — and it normalizes `..` on the way.

    `git check-ignore` consults the INDEX by default: a tracked file that also

    it keeps prompting — measured on git 2.55, and the reason `--no-index` must
